      "Ngày 26/4, Công an TP HCM cho biết, sau một tháng điều tra vụ 4 tiếp viên Vietnam Airlines mang hơn 11 kg ma tuý từ Pháp về Việt Nam, công an thành phố và các cơ quan chức năng phát hiện thêm 6 chuyến hàng có chứa ma túy đã được đưa về nước trên cùng tuyến đường vận chuyển này. Ma tuý được giấu trong các kiện hàng hóa, kem đánh răng, thực phẩm chức năng...\n",
      "\n",
      "Nhà chức trách đã khởi tố 22 vụ án, bắt 65 người (thông tin ban đầu là hơn 50 người) về hành vi Mua bán, vận chuyển, tàng trữ trái phép chất ma tuý, Không tố giác tội phạm và Che giấu tội phạm; xử lý vi phạm hành chính 12 người. Lực lượng chức năng thu giữ tổng cộng gần 50 kg ma tuý các loại, 2 khẩu súng và hàng loạt tang vật khác.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quá trình điều tra, Công an TP HCM đã phối hợp VKSND TP HCM, các đơn vị trong và ngoài ngành công an, làm rõ thủ đoạn của đường dây tội phạm xuyên quốc gia này. Ngoài việc lợi dụng 4 tiếp viên hàng không để vận chuyển ma tuý giấu trong hàng hoá về nước, băng tội phạm này còn tìm kiếm những người Việt đang học tập, định cư tại Pháp; hay dịch vụ chuyển phát nhanh hàng hóa quốc tế, để thuê xách loại hàng này.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khi ma tuý về đến sân bay Tân Sơn Nhất, Nội Bài, nhóm tội phạm sử dụng dịch vụ giao hàng nhanh trong nước để giao cho một người ở Đồng Nai tách thành từng kiện riêng, tiếp tục vận chuyển bằng đường bộ giao cho các đầu mối tại TP HCM, Bình Dương. Ma tuý sau đó được chia nhỏ, gửi đi tiêu thụ ở nhiều tỉnh thành.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nguồn tin của VnExpress cho biết: \"Ban chuyên án đã gặp rất nhiều khó khăn khi truy bắt các nghi can do thông tin về nhóm tội phạm này hạn chế, hầu hết họ không trực tiếp giao nhận ma tuý mà sử dụng các ứng dụng giao hàng công nghệ. Tuy nhiên, cảnh sát đã phối hợp với các đơn vị trong và ngoài ngành làm rõ từng đầu mối thông tin dù là nhỏ nhất\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Trước đó, sáng 16/3, cán bộ hải quan cửa khẩu sân bay quốc tế Tân Sơn Nhất phát hiện dấu hiệu bất thường trong hành lý của 4 tiếp viên Vietnam Airlines đi chuyến bay VN10 từ Pháp về. Kiểm tra, lực lượng chức năng tìm thấy tổng cộng hơn 8 kg thuốc lắc và hơn 3 kg cocain, ketamine (ma túy khay, loại đắt tiền nhất) trong valy của các tiếp viên.\n",
      "\n",
      "Các tiếp viên khai, khi ở Pháp đã nhận mang 60 kg hàng hoá về nước với tiền công hơn 10 triệu đồng. Do quá mệt mỏi vì vừa trải qua chuyến bay dài, họ chỉ xem qua loa vài tuýp kem, không thấy có gì bất thường. Khi ra sân bay của Pháp để về Việt Nam, lực lượng chức năng nước sở tại không phát hiện trong hành lý của họ có ma túy, cho đến khi về đến Tân Sơn Nhất.\n",
      "\n",
      "Đến tối 22/3, sau 6 ngày điều tra, Công an TP HCM đã trả tự do cho 4 tiếp viên, khởi tố vụ án Vận chuyển trái phép chất ma túy, đồng thời tạm giữ hai nghi can liên quan việc vận chuyển số ma tuý trên từ Pháp về Việt Nam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Việc trả tự do cho các tiếp viên căn cứ vào kết quả điều tra, xác định 4 tiếp viên không biết bên trong kem đánh răng nhận vận chuyển có 157 tuýp đã được giấu ma túy. Do đó không đủ căn cứ để truy cứu trách nhiệm hình sự.\n",
      "\n",
      "Công an TP HCM khuyến cáo người dân và các đơn vị kinh doanh dịch vụ chuyển phát nhanh nội địa và quốc tế cần cảnh giác, kiểm tra kỹ thông tin người gửi, nguồn gốc hàng hoá để tránh bị lợi dụng vận chuyển trái phép chất ma tuý; kịp thời báo công an và các cơ quan chức năng những kiện hàng có dấu hiệu bất thường để xử lý.\n",

      "We took a tour to Cai Rang Floating Market in Can Tho. In my memories from a dozen years ago, this place was bustling with people under the boat, the wooden benches were crowded and the noise was deafening.Life in the West River is now different. No more leisurely days of sitting on seven rocking chairs surrounded by fragrant trees and a few mangoes. The \"sell-it-all\" tree is no longer there.Next to the \"advertising tree\" with its heavy load of clothes and pans, was the peddler's pot. The guide was not sad to introduce the advertising tree - a tool for hanging products for promoting the typical products of the people.The vendors on the market were reminded again and again that the old \"Cai Rang\" has only 2 or 3 parts left now, although the demand for floating market visit is still very large. Every day, there are about 200 tourist boats carrying people.Of our tour - starting at 4am with excitement to the place once voted a must-see by the UK's Rough Guide - 10 people came to Can Tho and 7 went to the floating market of Cai Rang.The 10 most impressive markets in the world, with their \"bright and vibrant colors,\" end before 8 o'clock. Standing on the bank, my friend said in amazement, \"Is that really possible?\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Now looking back, I can appreciate your awe.\"Is that okay?\" can be used for many farm experience tours in Vietnam. Simple and inviting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agritourism in Vietnam has been booming for dozens of years and is rapidly developing.It has been fifteen years since then. The 2022 statistics of the General Tourism Department showed that the whole country has 365 rural tourism spots in 37 provinces, cities and more than 2,000 traditional craft villages with potential. With the advantage of opening upRural areas are seen as a source of resources, creating jobs locally, bringing in new sources of income, developing local economies... agricultural tourism is regarded as a promising direction for Vietnam.But after experiencing various types of agricultural tourism, from small farms in the North, homestays in the Central region, to tranquil gardens in the West, and a trip to Cai Rang Floating Market, I feelMost of this model is organized rigorously, but lacks connection in terms of scale. The rural tourism products of Vietnam are also monotonous, lack of creativity and refinement. Tourists have little choice.If \"riding a horse to see flowers\", not really harmonizing with oneself, experiencing deeply into the local culture - this is what they really want after having \"gone wild\" with the sea, bays, and bustling cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several years ago,The garden in Cồn Sơn, Cần Thơ once created an impressive impression on tourists with \"jumping fish\" - a fish trained to dance on the water surface to catch bait. And very quickly after that, jumping fish can be found anywhere, in Vĩnh Lon.Dong Thap, An Giang... they all know how to fly and jump. This lack of creativity not only creates boredom but also creates speculation with foreign tourists that all rural villages in Vietnam are like this. In the countrysideAgricultural local resources and special products of each province are neglected in rural tourism. South Korea is one of the countries that early understood this.Instead of imitating each other, the regions of South Korea have succeeded by choosing local resources and the traditional lifestyle of the residents to show off. Daeya Island in Chungcheongnam is an example.Daeya was once a wealthy island thanks to its exports of seaweed to Japan in the 1970s, but the Cheonsu bay reclamation project has changed the environment and the seaweed is no longer able to grow and develop as it once did.The economy of the people is difficult. In order to promote and restore the local image in agricultural tourism activities, Daeya Island innovates the form of \"doksal\" fishing (taking advantage of the convergence of rivers and seas).To make the bottom closure, it was transformed into an experience product. From there, the seafood sales and income from this activity helped the fishing village to become much richer, and people from other places came to start businesses more and more.Experience travel is a journey from one space to another. In other words, people leave their familiar surroundings to find a new and strange world. There they get to explore, feel and enjoy the unfamiliar.Not only the scenery, but also the cuisine, people, and daily rhythm. The modern urban space is no longer attractive to the city dwellers, and the demand for other space experience is very large. Many countries understand this and have taken action.The World Tourism Organization has evaluated that rural and eco-tourism have accounted for about 10% of total tourist arrivals, and they have been selling new and unusual space to those in need.With US$30 billion per year, Vietnam, thanks to its favorable climate conditions, customs, landscape, cuisine, diversified culture; abundant natural resources including forests, mountains, rivers, lakes, villages, etc. has enough potential to develop.Agritourism is becoming increasingly popular. However, due to lack of connectivity and coordination, agritourism spots in Vietnam are still being established crudely, as an example rather than a space to experience.This way of tourism really lacks culture. This approach causes a decrease in tourist numbers, not making use of the strengths of rural tourism, not taking advantage of local human resources, and not providing local people with opportunities to play a role.Money will not flow back to rural areas if rural tourism still only presents crude illustrations instead of creating a unique space of scenery and culture.Human activities and living.

      "We set off on a tour to Cai Rang Floating Market in Can Tho. In my memory of a dozen years ago, this place was full of people on the dock, crammed boats, and bustling sounds.The familiarity of life in the West River. But now, a winding river with seven chairs. The \"sell whatever\" tree is no longer the same as before, a few fragrant fruits, a fewMango tree. Right next to it, the \"hanging without selling\" tree was full of clothes and pots of the merchant. The guide wasn't bored to introduce the hanging tree - a tool to hang up products for advertising which was very characteristic.The trader at the market mentioned that the old Cai Rang Floating Market used to be \"crowded with 10 parts now only 2 to 3 left\", although the demand for tourism at the floating market is still very high. Every day there are about 200 boat trips.We took the guests to Can Tho, 10 guests arrived, 7 of them went to Cho Noi Cai Rang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our tour began at 4 am, with enthusiasm for the place that was once voted by the English Rough Guide.Ben Thanh Market is one of the 10 most impressive markets in the world due to its \"vibrant and colorful\" atmosphere - ending before 8 pm. Stepping on the banks, my friend still marveled: \"Is this real?\".\n",

      "Agritourism in Vietnam has been booming for the past few years.Rural tourism has been developing rapidly in the past few years with many forms. According to the 2022 statistics of the General Department of Tourism, the country has 365 rural tourism destinations in 37 provinces, cities and more than 2,000 craft villages.Agricultural tourism has potential. With the advantage of exploiting the strength of rural areas as a source of resources, creating jobs right on the spot, bringing new income sources, developing local economies ... agricultural tourism is developed.Evaluation is the potential direction of Vietnam. But after experiencing various types of agricultural tourism, from small farms in the North, homestays in the Central region, to garden spaces in the South.On my trip to Cái Răng Floating Market, I saw that most of this model was well organized, small and strong, each house was doing its own thing, lacking strong connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vietnam's Rural Tourism ProductsIt is monotonous, lacks creativity and refinement. Tourists mainly \"horse riding to view flowers\", they are not really immersed, experience deeply into the local culture space - what they really want after that.Already familiar with the sea, bay and bustling city.\n",
      "Several years back, the farmers in Cồn Sơn, Cần Thơ had left an impressive mark on tourists with their “flying carp” – a carp that was trained to dance on the surface of the water.Fried fish is a popular dish. And very soon after, anchovies from anywhere in Vinh Long, Dong Thap, An Giang ... all know how to jump and fly. This lack of creativity not only causes boredom but also creates speculation.Foreign tourists say that it is the same for any rural villages in Vietnam. Meanwhile, local agricultural resources and special products of each province are being neglected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Village tourism needs to be respected and developed.Emphasizing local characteristics. South Korea is one of the countries that early understood this. Instead of copying each other, the localities of South Korea successfully chose their own local resources and cultural activities.The wealth of the islanders was on display. Daeya Island in Chungcheongnam is an example. Daeya used to be a wealthy island thanks to the export of marine products to Japan in the 1970s, but the Cheonsu Bay reclamation project has changed that.The environment has been completely changed, the sea is no longer lively and developing like before, the local people's agricultural economy is difficult. In order to boost and restore the local image in agricultural tourism activities.In Daeya Island, the \"doksal\" fishing method (utilizing the confluence of rivers and seas to form a closed base for fishing) was innovated into an experiential product. Thus, seafood sales and income from fishing increased.This activity helps the village to become much richer and more people from other places come to set up businesses every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experience tourism is a journey from one space to another. In other words, people travel from one place to another to learn and explore.People leave their familiar space to find another. There they can explore, experience, and enjoy not only the scenery, but also the cuisine, people, and everyday rhythm. In the urban landscape.In modern urban spaces, there is no longer any appeal for city dwellers, and the need for another kind of space experience is very large. And successful countries understand this and sell this space to people.There is a need.\n",
      "However, due to lack of connectivity and synchronization, agricultural tourist spots in Vietnam are still built in a rudimentary way, as an illustration rather than a space for experience.This organization is not only detrimental to tourists, but also fails to take advantage of the strengths of rural tourism, cannot use local human resources, and does not bring benefits to the local peopleRural communities play a major role in their own cultural space. The World Tourism Organization estimates that rural tourism and sustainability account for about 10% of total tourism.Vietnam has attracted 30 billion USD in tourism revenue per year thanks to its favorable climate, customs, scenery, diverse cuisine, and abundant natural resources such as forests, mountains, rivers, and lakes, as well as traditional villages.The temple, the fruit trees... have enough potential to develop agricultural tourism. But, money will not flow back to the countryside, if agricultural tourism still only presents simple illustrations, instead of creating a unique experience.The spectacular space of human perception, culture, and activity. -Nguyen Nam Cuong\n",

However, Zakharova added that Ukraine and the West \"showed their ability to disrupt it\".Recently, Beijing announced a 12-point peace plan for Ukraine. China declared its support for the sovereignty of all countries according to international law, and opposed any use of force.Nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction, opposed to the UN Security Council's resolution, which was not adopted. Russia and Belarus supported the proposal, but Western countries argued that the plan was not effective enough.This reflection does not fully reflect the war.
